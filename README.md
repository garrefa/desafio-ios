# Github JavaPop
This app navigates through all public repositories on Github where the main programming language is Java.

## Developer notes
This repository doesn't squash commits, so that anyone can follow the complete development process, commit by commit.
The scenes were composed using a customized version of the Clean Swift templates. You can find the original ones at http://clean-swift.com/.


## Running the project
This project was built using Xcode 8.2.
Pods are tracked in the repository and Pod's versions are fixed, so every commit carries all the dependencies and you shouldn't need to run `pod install` before.
Before you build the project you may notice a missing file called `R.generated.swift`; This file will be generated in a build phase.
The app is already localized for en_US and pt-BR.

## Running all tests
Under construction.
